#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ci-lock.sh — machine-wide mutual exclusion for the BC/SQL container stack.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every pipeline in this repo drives the stack with
#
#     docker compose down --remove-orphans
#     docker compose up -d
#
# and Compose derives the project name from the working directory's basename,
# which is `bc-linux` for every job everywhere. So two jobs that land on the
# same docker host address the SAME containers — `bc-linux-bc-1`,
# `bc-linux-sql-1` — no matter how their workspaces are laid out. The second
# job's `down` deletes the first job's BC mid-test.
#
# That is issue #24. What made it expensive to diagnose is that the symptom
# points nowhere near the cause: both jobs die with GitHub's generic
#
#     The runner has received a shutdown signal.
#     Process completed with exit code 143.
#
# which reads as "somebody stopped the runner service", not "another job
# deleted my container". Two PR builds on one self-hosted runner reproduced it
# exactly; retriggering either one alone passed with no other change.
#
# The fixed host ports in docker-compose.yml (7045-7089, 8080, 11433) mean the
# same thing from the other direction: even with distinct project names, two
# concurrent stacks on one machine cannot both bind them. Sharing the machine
# is inherently serial unless the caller has explicitly moved the ports, which
# is what the reusable workflows' `instance_slot` input does.
#
# So this is a lease, not an isolation scheme: hold it around the whole
# down/up/publish/test region and concurrent jobs queue instead of destroying
# each other. It is the same instinct as `download-artifacts.sh`'s flock on the
# artifact cache, extended to the resource the flock never covered.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/ci-lock.sh acquire <name> [--wait-minutes N] [--max-hold-minutes N]
#   scripts/ci-lock.sh release <name>
#   scripts/ci-lock.sh status  <name>
#
# `acquire` blocks until the lease is free, then prints — and, under GitHub
# Actions, appends to $GITHUB_ENV — the token that `release` needs:
#
#   BC_CI_LOCK_TOKEN=<random>
#
# so the release step in a later part of the same job identifies itself. A
# release without a matching token is refused rather than stealing somebody
# else's lease, which matters because the workflows run it with `if: always()`.
#
# WHY NOT flock(1)
# ----------------
# flock holds only as long as the process holding the fd. A CI job's steps are
# separate processes, so the lock has to outlive the step that took it. This
# keeps a lease FILE, refreshed by a background heartbeat, and treats a lease
# nobody has touched for BC_CI_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS as abandoned. That is also
# what makes the failure mode self-healing: a job killed the way the two in
# issue #24 were killed leaves its lease behind, its heartbeat dies with the
# job's process group, and the next job takes over ~2 minutes later instead of
# being blocked until somebody logs in.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   BC_CI_LOCK_DIR              where leases live. Default /var/tmp/bc-linux-ci-locks.
#                               MUST be shared by everything sharing the docker
#                               daemon — if your runners are themselves
#                               containers talking to a mounted docker socket,
#                               point this at a path mounted into all of them.
#   BC_CI_LOCK_TOKEN            set by acquire, consumed by release.
#   BC_CI_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS    abandonment threshold. Default 120.
#   BC_CI_LOCK_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS  refresh interval. Default 30.
#   BC_CI_LOCK_POLL_SECONDS     wait-loop interval. Default 5.
#   BC_CI_LOCK_DISABLE=1        make acquire/release no-ops. Escape hatch for a
#                               machine where the lease dir cannot be shared and
#                               the operator knows jobs never overlap.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  acquired / released / (status) free
#   1  usage error, or the lease could not be created at all
#   2  acquire timed out — another job still holds the stack
#   3  (status) held by somebody else
